Dynamic Programming

1. Tabulation -> Bottom-up
2. Memoization -> Top-down

Memoization - tend to store the value of sub problems in some map/table.

Steps of Dynamic Programming:
0. Declare dp array
1. Store recursion value into dp -> dp[n]
2. Check dp arrap -> if problem is already solved

Things to see if the question is DP:
-> Count the total number of ways
-> Min/ Max

Things to apply recursion:
-> To try all possible ways

Short cut for DP problems:
1. Try to represent the problem in terms of index
2. Do all possible stuffs on that index according to the problem statement 
3. If question says
  1. Sum of all stuffs -> count all ways
  2. min of all stuffs -> find min
  3. max of all stuffs -> find max
