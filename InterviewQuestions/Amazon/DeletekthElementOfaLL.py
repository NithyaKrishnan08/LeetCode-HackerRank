# Delete the kth element of a Linked List

'''
Problem Statement: Given a linked list, delete the kth element of the linked list and print the updated linked list.

Note: K will always be between 1 and N, where N is the length of the LL.

Example 1:
Input Format: 12->5->8->7, k=3

Result: 12->5->7

Explanation: Again, the third element of the list is 8. After removing the third node, the list has 5 pointing to 7, as shown in the result.
