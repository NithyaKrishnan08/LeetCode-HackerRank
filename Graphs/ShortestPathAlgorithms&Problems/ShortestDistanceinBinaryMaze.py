# Shortest Distance in a Binary Maze

'''
Problem Statement: 

Given an n * m matrix grid where each element can either be 0 or 1. You need to find the shortest distance between a given source cell to a destination cell. The path can only be created out of a cell if its value is 1. 

If the path is not possible between the source cell and the destination cell, then return -1.

Note: You can move into an adjacent cell if that adjacent cell is filled with element 1. Two cells are adjacent if they share a side. In other words, you can move in one of four directions, Up, Down, Left, and Right.

Examples:

Example 1:

Input:
grid[][] = {{1, 1, 1, 1},
            {1, 1, 0, 1},
            {1, 1, 1, 1},
            {1, 1, 0, 0},
            {1, 0, 0, 1}}
source = {0, 1}
destination = {2, 2}
Output:
3

Explanation: 

1 1 1 1
1 1 0 1
1 1 1 1
1 1 0 0
1 0 0 1
The highlighted part in the above matrix denotes the shortest path from source to destination cell.

Example 2:

Input:
grid[][] = {{1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
            {1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
            {1, 1, 1, 1, 0},
            {1, 0, 1, 0, 1}}
source = {0, 0}
destination = {3, 4}
Output:
-1 
Explanation: 
Since, there is no path possible between the source cell and the destination cell, hence we return -1.
